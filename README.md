## Overview

A React-based terminal clone with a twist! Before you can use the terminal, you must first remove a pesky virus ü¶†. Once the virus is gone, you can chat with the computer and ask it anything about me, Deniz, the creator. The computer responds with a touch of romance, thanks to the Google Palm API.

## Technologies

- React (TypeScript)
- Vite
- Google Palm API

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

\```bash
git clone https://github.com/DenizYunus/my-terminal-portfolio.git
cd my-terminal-portfolio
npm install
\```

## Usage

Run the application in your local development environment:

\```bash
npm run dev
\```

1. **Kill the Virus**: Think what you can do to kill the virus that's initially in the terminal.

2. **Chat Interface**: After clearing the virus, (after the access key entrance) you can begin to chat with the computer.

3. **Access Key**: To utilize the full features, enter the provided access key in the top right text area.

## How to get the Access Key

The Access Key for the Google Palm API will be provided in my CV for recruiters. For everyone else, you should get one for you on [Maker Suite of Google](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).
